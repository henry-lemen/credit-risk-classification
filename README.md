# credit-risk-classification

This repository contains my submission for the credit risk classification challenge. Using numpy, pandas, pathlib, and sklearn, the code accurately achieve the goal of the assignment and runs without error.


Questions from the challenge:

Q: How well does the logistic regression model predict both the `0` (healthy loan) and `1` (high-risk loan) labels?
A: The model does a good job of predicting both healthy and high-risk loans labels. The accuracy score of the model is .99. This represents that 99% of the predicted outcomes are correct.
