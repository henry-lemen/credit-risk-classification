# credit-risk-classification

This repository contains my submission for the credit risk classification challenge. Using numpy, pandas, pathlib, and sklearn, the code accurately achieve the goal of the assignment and runs without error.

In the repository, you will also find a report containing an analysis of the data and the findings.
